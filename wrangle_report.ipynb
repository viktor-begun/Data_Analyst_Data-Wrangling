    "# The findings:\n",
    "1. The manual check of the figures shows that even with all three predictions as not dogs, there might be a dog in the picture, see, for example, the [link](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DBW35ZsVoAEWZUU.jpg). Therefore, in order to clean this issue, one needs a manual check, or a better prediction algorithm, which is beyond the scope of this project.\n",
    "2. The `retweet count` and `favorite count` are correlated with each other with the correlation coefficient 0.93. However, they are practically independent from `rating numerator` and day of a week. \n",
    "3. A small correlation is observed between the length of the description `text`, `p2_dog` and `p1_conf` with the `favorite_count` only. The corresponding correlation coefficient can be rounded to 0.1. \n",
    "4. The most tweets are unclassified: `None` - 1661 tweets, `pupper` - 201, `doggo` - 62, `puppo` - 22, `floofer` - 7.\n",
    "5. The `None` and `pupper` distributions are non-gaussian, with heavy right tale, while `doggo`, `puppo` and `floofer` distributions have too litle entries to define the shape, see figures below.\n",
    "6. The favorite count distribution for `None` has two peaks. It may indicate that there is a group of unclasified images, which are much more popular than the rest.\n",
    "7. The average number of `favorite_count` is several times larger than the `retweet_count` for every dog 'stage', see figures below.\n",
    "8. The unclassified `None` tweets have similar popularity as `pupper`, while `doggo`, `puppo` and `floofer` are much popular in both the number of retweets and the number of favorite counts."
