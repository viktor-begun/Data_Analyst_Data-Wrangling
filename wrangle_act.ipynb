    "# Introduction (from Udacity)\n",
    "The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\" WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Motivation\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "Your goal: wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for \"Wow!\"-worthy analyses and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "### Enhanced Twitter Archive\n",
    "\n",
    "The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog \"stage\" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive \"enhanced.\" Of the 5000+ tweets, I have filtered for tweets with ratings only (there are 2356).\n",
    "\n",
    "I extracted this data programmatically, but I didn't do a very good job. The ratings probably aren't all correct. Same goes for the dog names and probably dog stages (see below for more information on these) too. You'll need to assess and clean these columns if you want to use them for analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Data via the Twitter API\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the basic-ness of Twitter archives: retweet count and favorite count are two of the notable column omissions. Fortunately, this additional data can be gathered by anyone from Twitter's API. Well, \"anyone\" who has access to data for the 3000 most recent tweets, at least. But you, because you have the WeRateDogs Twitter archive and specifically the tweet IDs within it, can gather this data for all 5000+. And guess what? You're going to query Twitter's API to gather this valuable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Predictions File\n",
    "\n",
    "One more cool thing: I ran every image in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive through a neural network that can classify breeds of dogs*. The results: a table full of image predictions (the top three only) alongside each tweet ID, image URL, and the image number that corresponded to the most confident prediction (numbered 1 to 4 since tweets can have up to four images).\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's all fun and good. But all of this additional data will need to be gathered, assessed, and cleaned. This is where you come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points\n",
    "Key points to keep in mind when data wrangling for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You only want original ratings (**no retweets**) that have **images**. Though there are 5000+ tweets in the dataset, **not all are dog** ratings and some are retweets.\n",
    "- Assessing and cleaning the entire dataset completely would require a lot of time, and is not necessary to practice and demonstrate your skills in data wrangling. Therefore, the requirements of this project are only to assess and clean at least **8 quality issues** and at least **2 tidiness issues** in this dataset.\n",
    "- Cleaning includes **merging individual pieces** of data according to the rules of tidy data.\n",
    "- The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This unique rating system is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.\n",
    "- You do not need to gather the tweets beyond August 1st, 2017. You can, but note that you won't be able to gather the image predictions for these tweets since you don't have access to the algorithm used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gathering Data for the Project\n",
    "Gather each of the three pieces of data as described below in a Jupyter Notebook titled `wrangle_act.ipynb`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The WeRateDogs Twitter archive. I am giving this file to you, so imagine it as a file on hand. Download this file manually by clicking the following link: [`twitter_archive_enhanced.csv`](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/59a4e958_twitter-archive-enhanced/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file (`image_predictions.tsv`) is hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and the following URL: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Gather each tweet's **retweet count** and **favorite (\"like\") count** at minimum, and any additional data you find interesting. Using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, \n",
    "- query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) library and \n",
    "- store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called `tweet_json.txt` file. \n",
    "- Each tweet's JSON data should be written to its own line. \n",
    "- Then read this .txt file line by line into a pandas DataFrame with (at minimum) **tweet ID**, **retweet count**, and **favorite count**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: do not include your Twitter API keys, secrets, and tokens in your project submission.*"
