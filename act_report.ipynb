The ratio of the number of `pupper`'s, `doggo`'s, `puppo`'s and `floofer`'s to each other is approximately 3. There are 3 times more `pupper`'s than `doggo`'s, and three times more `doggo`'s than `puppo`'s.

The `pupper` on average is as popular as an unclassified tweet, while `doggo`, `puppo` and `floofer` are more popular. It suggests that the popularity is driven by the figures themselves. If the figure is popular, then it get's the \"stage\" name, which does not matter, if it is `pupper`, and is significantly better, when it is either `doggo`, `puppo` or `floofer`."
